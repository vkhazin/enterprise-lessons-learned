# Introduction

I have worked in more organisations and companies in 4 countries than I can enumerate and this book is a collection of anti-patterns observed and thoughts on how it hurts the entities.

The thoughts shared here are not specific to any one organization in particular.

Any resemblance to real entities, existing or defunct, is purely coincidental.

The author does not intend to single out, offend, harm, or misrepresent any company or organization.

The thoughts are broken down to organisational and technical anti-patterns&#x20;
